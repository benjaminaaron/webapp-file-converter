## a straightforward file converter
Drop the file and the converted version downloads right away. Processing happens locally, works offline.

*Just a mockup at this point.*

Besides converting from specific source to target formats I want to add functionality to extract stuff from files based on pre- or selfdefined patterns. Maybe also things like filling a template and getting a wxr-formatted .xml file for import in Wordpress...

The rules for conversion and extraction I'd like to store in a DB like Firebase, in that way the entire system is build to be extended by anyone and their usecases.
